Kubernetes (K8s) is a system that runs and manages(orchestration) applications in containers across multiple computers.
It automatically starts, stops, restarts, scales, and load-balances your apps, so you don’t have to manage servers or failures manually.

🖥️ PCs = Worker Nodes

Your physical computers are worker nodes in Kubernetes.

They provide:

CPU

RAM

Disk

Network

They are just machines.

📦 Pods = Running Applications (Containers)

A Pod:

Runs one or more containers

Usually one container = one application (Node.js app)

So in your case:

Pod
 └── Container (Node.js app)


👉 Pods run containers
👉 Containers run your app

You have 3 PCs:

PC-1
PC-2
PC-3


You deploy a Node.js app with 5 replicas:

PC-1 → Pod (Node.js), Pod (Node.js)
PC-2 → Pod (Node.js), Pod (Node.js)
PC-3 → Pod (Node.js)

Each Pod:

Runs one Node.js container

Has its own IP

Is isolated from other pods
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PC are worker nodes and pods are running applications or containers.

Your Physical Setup

You have 3 physical computers:

PC-1
PC-2
PC-3


Each PC is a worker node in Kubernetes.

Case 1: 3 Pods on 3 Computers

You say:

replicas: 3


Kubernetes tries to spread them out:

PC-1 → Pod 1 (Node.js)
PC-2 → Pod 2 (Node.js)
PC-3 → Pod 3 (Node.js)


✔ One pod per machine
✔ Best availability

Case 2: Scale from 3 Pods → 5 Pods

You say:

replicas: 5


You still have only 3 computers, so Kubernetes does this:

PC-1 → Pod 1, Pod 4
PC-2 → Pod 2, Pod 5
PC-3 → Pod 3


👉 Yes — multiple pods run on the same computer

This is how Kubernetes works.
