Private IP addresses (inside your network)

Your router assigns private IPs to each device 
(usually via DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)).

Example:

Device A: 192.168.1.2

Device B: 192.168.1.3

Device C: 192.168.1.4

Device D: 192.168.1.5

Router (gateway): 192.168.1.1

What DHCP does

When a device (phone, laptop, PC, smart TV) joins your network, DHCP provides:

IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.10)

Subnet mask (e.g. 255.255.255.0)

Default gateway (your router, e.g. 192.168.1.1)

DNS servers (to resolve websites like google.com)

Without DHCP, you would have to enter all of this manually on every device.

How DHCP works (DORA process)

DHCP works in four simple steps, called DORA:

1. Discover

The device broadcasts:

“Is there any DHCP server here?”

2. Offer

The DHCP server (usually your router) replies:

“I can give you IP 192.168.1.10.”

3. Request

The device responds:

“Yes, I want that IP.”

4. Acknowledge

The server confirms:

“IP assigned. You can use it.”

✔️ Now the device can communicate on the network.

Example in a home network

Your router:

Runs a DHCP server

Automatically assigns IPs to all connected devices.
